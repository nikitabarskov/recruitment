Probably you understand what we mean by this slightly imprecise language. If you do, ignore the following mathematical way to formulate the same thing. A `(m, n)`-path of length `k` is the image of an injective order preserving function `[k] -> [m] x [n]` whose composites with the projections `pr_1: [m] x [n] -> [m]` and `pr_2: [m] x [n] -> [n]` onto the first and second factor, respectively, are surjective.\n",
