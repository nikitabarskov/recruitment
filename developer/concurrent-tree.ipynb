    "In the meat industry or more generally, in supply chain management, graph algorithms are very important. Furthermore, there are connections between graph algorithms and optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an interactive software solution that functions as a planning and decision tool for the meat industry. The capabilities of such a solution would be powered by various ways of analyzing graphs. These analyses would be run both in data pipelines and would also tie directly into user experience through interactive simulations requested by the users of the solution. Now, this means that graph algorithms must sometimes be fast and there is a potential for exceeding the memory of a single machine, which would prompt spilling data to disk and/or provisioning a cluster for calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for speed in an interactive software solution would spark the need for concurrent graph algorithms. Moreover, if a concurrent graph algorithm can be adapted to run on a cluster, then it is an important step towards scaling the business to handling more data or more complex problems."

    "An undirected graph consists of nodes or vertices together with a set of edges, meaning unordered pairs of nodes. A graph is connected if there is a path between any two nodes. A tree is a connected acyclic (with no cycles) graph. A spanning tree of a graph G=(V, E) is a tree whose nodes are the nodes V of G and whose edges form a subset of E. Finally, a minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree with the minimal number of edges."
